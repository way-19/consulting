## Country Panel Replication

Once the `/ge` (Georgia) panel is complete and stable, it should be used as the template for other country panels such as `/usa`, `/uk`, etc. Clone the `/ge` directory and adjust content, logic, and AI context accordingly for each country. Avoid duplicating placeholder components.

New countries can be added via the Admin Panel â†’ "Add Country" page. Each country entry should include:
- name (e.g., Spain)
- code (e.g., es)
- flag_emoji (e.g., ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸)

Ensure all new panels use `country_id` and `flag_emoji` for dynamic configuration.

## Country Slug Normalization & Deployment

- Georgia's slug is always `georgia`; the shorter `ge` form is not used.
- The `normalizeCountrySlug` function ensures routes resolve to either `georgia` or `global`.
- Netlify uses the `_redirects` file to serve SPA routes for deep links.
- Incrementing the `CACHE_NAME` in `public/sw.js` invalidates old service workers. Users may need to hard-refresh after deployment.

## Supabase Data Integrity

- Georgia's country record must use the slug `georgia`; legacy `ge` values should be avoided.
- Consultant dashboards rely on the `consultant_country_assignments` and `applications` tables to link consultants, countries and clients.
- Run periodic checks or migrations to ensure no `ge` slugs remain in the database.
