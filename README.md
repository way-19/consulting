## Country Panel Replication

Once the `/ge` (Georgia) panel is complete and stable, it should be used as the template for other country panels such as `/usa`, `/uk`, etc. Clone the `/ge` directory and adjust content, logic, and AI context accordingly for each country. Avoid duplicating placeholder components.

New countries can be added via the Admin Panel â†’ "Add Country" page. Each country entry should include:
- name (e.g., Spain)
- code (e.g., es)
- flag_emoji (e.g., ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸)

Ensure all new panels use `country_id` and `flag_emoji` for dynamic configuration.
