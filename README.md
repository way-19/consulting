## Country Panel Replication

Once the `/ge` (Georgia) panel is complete and stable, it should be used as the template for other country panels such as `/usa`, `/uk`, etc. Clone the `/ge` directory and adjust content, logic, and AI context accordingly for each country. Avoid duplicating placeholder components.

New countries can be added via the Admin Panel â†’ "Add Country" page. Each country entry should include:
- name (e.g., Spain)
- code (e.g., es)
- flag_emoji (e.g., ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸)

Ensure all new panels use `country_id` and `flag_emoji` for dynamic configuration.

## Country Slug Normalization & Deployment

- Georgia's slug is always `georgia`; the shorter `ge` form is not used.
- The `normalizeCountrySlug` function ensures routes resolve to either `georgia` or `global`.
- Netlify uses the `_redirects` file to serve SPA routes for deep links.
- Incrementing the `CACHE_NAME` in `public/sw.js` invalidates old service workers. Users may need to hard-refresh after deployment.

## Supabase Data Integrity

- Georgia's country record must use the slug `georgia`; legacy `ge` values should be avoided.
- Consultant dashboards rely on the `consultant_country_assignments` and `applications` tables to link consultants, countries and clients.
- Run periodic checks or migrations to ensure no `ge` slugs remain in the database.

## Country Content Management

Consultants can manage the public site for each country via the **Country Content Management** module at `/[country-slug]/consultant-dashboard/country-content`.

### Managing Content

- **Services** â€“ create, edit and delete service offerings for a country. Each service stores a `language`, `title`, `description`, optional `image_url`, `features[]` and `slug` in the `country_services` table.
- **FAQs** â€“ manage frequently asked questions per country and language in the `country_faqs` table.
- **Haberler & Blog** â€“ publish news or blog posts with title, slug, excerpt, content, cover image and status. Posts are saved in `country_news` with a `language` column.
- **SEO & Meta** â€“ edit `meta_title`, `meta_description` and `meta_keywords` for the Home, Services, FAQs and Blog pages. Data lives in `country_meta` keyed by `country_id`, `page` and `language`.

### Multi-language Support

All content forms include a language selector (currently `tr` and `en`). Translations are stored as separate rows per language. When a translation is missing the frontend can fall back to the default language.

### Notes

- The module loads only the countries assigned to the logged-in consultant. If no countries are assigned, a friendly message is displayed.
- Test accounts remain available for demo/login, but all operational data is stored in Supabase tables mentioned above.

## Environment variables & Deploy notes

Set the following variables for deployments (e.g., Netlify â†’ Site settings â†’ Build & deploy â†’ Environment):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://fwgaekupwecsruxjebb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = <anon_jwt>
VITE_SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_URL = https://fwgaekupwecsruxjebb.supabase.co/functions/v1
```

After setting these, redeploy the site so Vite injects them into the bundle.
